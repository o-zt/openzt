Simple proof of concept DLL for injection into [Zoo Tycoon (2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_Tycoon_(2001_video_game)). Currently just patches a single call to a function that loads some debug settings from the zoo.ini file. Further reverse engineering of the class strucutre is required to patch anythign else (WIP).
